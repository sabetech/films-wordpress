Test WordPress Application

This is a WordPress site designed to provide information about Films using the Unite Template. The admin section enables the user to:

1.) Add a Film
2.) Specify the genre, country, year, actor for the movie being added

When adding a film, the user can add custom text fields like Ticket Price and Release Date.


Using the link http://{domain}/films/, it would list the added films.
Clicking a film shows the full description of the movie.
